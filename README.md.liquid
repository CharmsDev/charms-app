This is a [Charms](charms.dev) app.

It is a simple fungible token managed by a reference NFT. The NFT has a state that specifies the remaining total supply of the tokens available to mint. If you control the NFT, you can mint new tokens.

Build with:
```sh
charms app build
```

The resulting RISC-V binary will show up at
`./target/elf-compilation/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf/release/{{project-name}}` (as well as `./elf/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf`).

Get the verification key for the app with:
```sh
charms app vk
```

Put the VK into appropriate app specs in your spell sources (e.g. `./spells/send.yaml`):
```yaml
apps:
  $TOKEN_MAN: n/312de6129de1a2a3de9dd22bca0bbb351853e7a5b4acb4b48676816055f08bb1:0/<VK>
  $TOKEN: t/312de6129de1a2a3de9dd22bca0bbb351853e7a5b4acb4b48676816055f08bb1:0/<VK>
```

Test the app for a spell with:
```sh
charms app run <./spells/send.yaml
```

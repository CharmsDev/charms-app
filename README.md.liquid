This is a [Charms](charms.dev) app.

It is a simple fungible token managed by a reference NFT. The NFT has a state that specifies the remaining total supply of the tokens available to mint. If you control the NFT, you can mint new tokens.

Build with:
```sh
charms app build
```

The resulting RISC-V binary will show up at
`./target/elf-compilation/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf/release/{{project-name}}` (as well as `./elf/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf`).

Get the verification key for the app with:
```sh
charms app vk
```

Test the app for a spell with:
```sh
charms app run <./spells/send.yml
```
